LDI_test
========

LDI_test is gui framework for OpenCv.
The idea is that we have processing blocks that are connected betwene 
each other and that every processing block has its own gui control. Gui 
controls can be easily made using tools like wxDesigner which generates 
gui code and processing code can be easily imported into these blocks by 
implementing simple processing class. You can see example in 
Options1Derived.cpp file.
